## What is Scroll Magic API Study?
The Scroll Magic API Study is an exploration of an extremely useful and realtively easy to use scroll interaction library.  
At its core, the library helps animate web elements based on the user scroll position.  In the study example, when the user scrolls
down from the landing section, the product element on the left will "pin" to a specfic point while on the right content will scroll.

## Does the Scroll Magic API Study feature commentary?
Yes!  I use extensive commentary in the study, specifically in the CSS and JavaScript files, as well as the processNotes file where I attempt to lay out the
step-by-step process I take creating the study example.
